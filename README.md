## Configuration

### Remote Probe Configuration

Services configuration is done by editing the file **appsettings.json** and restarting application.

:warning: ***Please be informed that accounts with 2FA are not supported.***

#### Example:
```json
{
    "Configurations": {
    "Url": "http://192.168.100.190:3001/",
    "Token": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_UPTIME_KUMA_TOKEN",
    "Username": "admin",
    "Password": "Admin123",
    "ProbeName": "Home",
    "UpDependency": "192.168.1.1",
    "Timeout": 1000,
    "Delay": 60000,
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "PGSQL": "Host=localhost;Database=postgres;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
    },
    "WhoisApiUrl": "https://whoisjson.com/api/v1/whois?domain=keep.this&format=json",
    "WhoisApiToken": "whoisjsonApiToken"
    }
}
```
>- **Token**: If set the probe will use it to authenticate and if not it falls back to Username/Password.
>- **UpDependency**: Should be a trustable IP in your network, your ISP gateway for example. In case of this IP is not available, no other checks will be executed.
>- **Delay**: is the delay time between checks. It is expressed in milliseconds, in this example 1 minute = 60000 ms between each round.
>- **ProbeName**: Will help the probe identify the monitors that should be fetched from UK instance.
>- **WhoisApiToken**: 
>   - You need an account registered on [Whois Json](https://whoisjson.com/) if you want Domain check. 
>   - This service has a api call limit of 500 per month, which would be enough since this check will run once a day only, or at the probe restart. 
>   - By default if the domain expiration date is < 30 days, probe will not push to UK and generate an alert.
